# Instructions

To make this work, you'll need to set the following environment variables:

- `CINODE_COMPANY_ID`
- `CINODE_COMPANY_NAME`
- `CINODE_ACCESS_ID`
- `CINODE_ACCESS_SECRET`

The company name is the `yourcompany` part in the Cinode URL.
To obtain the other variables, Create a personal API account under https://app.cinode.com/yourcompany/account and copy the company ID, Access ID and Access secret.
